# petizio

Petizio is a petition creating and voting app that allows users to vote pseudo-anonymously. Petizio has three main strengths; 

* One vote is one vote: The confirmation method prevents a single agent to vote multiple times.
* Anonymity: When the issues are being voted for, it is not known who supports the ideas, people can vote without revealing their identity.
* Technology Acceptance: Petitions are a low-risk, high-reward environment that allows the general public to familiarize themselves with the idea of blockchain in governmental processes.
